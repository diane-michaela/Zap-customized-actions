1: Button

Goal: trying to manually configure (in Advanced mode) an explicit Slack API chat.postMessage request that posts a hiring-request message using Slack Block Kit, so I can control the exact UI (text + buttons) with no AI/Copilot, and make it compatible with Slack’s New Interaction workflow.

Specifically, I want to edit your existing Custom Slack Action (not create a new one) so the posted hiring-request message:
removes the static_select (“Select a name”) dropdown, and adds five URL buttons at the bottom under “Assign recruiter:” (Tasha, Maria, MJ, Sito, Diane) using placeholder webhook URLs that end with ?assignee=<name>, with styles: Tasha + Diane = primary, MJ + Sito + Maria = danger, while keeping all existing hiring request details in the message.

Important: Place_holder webhook is the code generated during the second Zap, Zap B trigger that will generate a catch hook, which mean that, first, create Zap A with imcomplete catch hook data, then create zap B and add in the zap A customised action the url catch hook generated by zap B (why two zap? because catch hook always need to be a triggered action) 

2: Get Document Content 

Goal: You want to extract the content of a Google Doc and have it available as plain text.
Inputs: You might need to provide the Google Doc ID to specify which document you want to retrieve.
Output: The content of the document should be returned as plain text.
